                      Before you can get started using your TAC we need to set
                      up a few things so they match your preferences. Some of
                      these preferences can only be set via the web interface in
                      this special setup mode, because they affect the security
                      and inner workings of your TAC. To configure them once the
                      setup mode is done you either need ssh access to your TAC
                      or physical access to re-enable the setup mode via the
                      buttons on the TAC.

                        The LXA TAC comes with a mostly pre-configured labgrid
                        exporter, that exports a lot of resources that are built
                        into the TAC or can be connected to it via USB.
                        <br />
                        You may however want to configure the labgrid
                        coordinator IP address/hostname on the "Environment" tab
                        or export additional resources in the "User Config" tab.
                        <br />
                        Once you have made the required changes click "Save" and
                        test your configuration by clicking "Next".
