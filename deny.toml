# I've removed most of the lines from the template config generated via
# cargo deny init to keep this readable.
# If you want to change something it may be worthwhile to run cargo deny init
# to get an overview of the options and their defaults.

# Note that all fields that take a lint level have these possible values:
# * deny - An error will be produced and the check will fail
# * warn - A warning will be produced, but the check will not fail
# * allow - No warning or error will be produced, though in some cases a note
# will be
