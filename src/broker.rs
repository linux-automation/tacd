    /// process them and set the ro topic without any transient events on the
    /// topic containing an invalid state.
    ///
    /// # Arguments
    ///
    /// * `path` - Where to mount the MQTT topic and REST resource
    /// * `web_readable` - Should this resource be externally readable?
    /// * `web_writable` - Should this resource be externally writable?
    /// * `initial` - Retained value to return before set() was called the
    ///   first time. Or None
    /// * `retained_length` - Number of previously set values to retain
    ///   and push out when subscribing to the serialized stream.
    ///   This will usually be 1 so that the most recent value is available
    ///   when doing a GET request to the topic via the REST API.
    ///   It can also be 0 for topics that are purely transient events like
    ///   button presses that go away as soon as they happen.
    ///   It can also be a larger value to store up some history that should
    ///   be pushed out to new (outside) subscribers as soon as they subscribe,
    ///   to e.g. pre-populate a graph in the web interface.
